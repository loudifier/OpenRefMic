16           SnapMagic Search INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY POLICY

16.1        Copyright: SnapMagic Search respects the intellectual property of others and asks that users of our Site and Site Materials do the same. When using the Site or Site Materials and creating Submissions, make sure that you are using either original works or have obtained the applicable consent of any third party to use such works for that purpose, in order not to infringe on the intellectual property rights, including copyright, of others. We reserve the right to delete or disable your Submissions and any Content alleged to be infringing and to terminate repeat infringers. In connection with our Site and Site Materials, SnapMagic Search has adopted and implemented a policy respecting Intellectual Property that provides for the removal of any infringing or unauthorized materials or Content and for the account termination, in appropriate circumstances determined in the sole discretion of SnapMagic Search, of users of our online Site and Site Materials who are infringers of Intellectual Property Rights or who submit unauthorized content.

16.2        Notice by Copyright Owners: If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any Content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") by providing our Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (pursuant to 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3)):

á       A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;

á       Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;

á       Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled

á       Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material;

á       Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail;

á       A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and

á       A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Please note that, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. ¤ 512(f), any misrepresentation of material fact (falsities) in a written notification automatically subjects the complaining party to liability for any damages, costs and attorney's fees incurred by us in connection with the written notification and allegation of copyright infringement.

You may direct copyright infringement notifications to our Copyright Agent ("Copyright Agent"):

Notification from a copyright owner or from a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner that fails to comply substantially with the provisions above shall not be considered as providing actual knowledge or an awareness of facts or circumstances from which infringing or otherwise unauthorized activity is apparent.

For clarity, only DMCA notices should go to the Copyright Agent; any other feedback, comments, requests for technical support, and other communications should be directed to customer support at info@snapeda.com.

16.3        Counter-Notice: If you believe that your Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the applicable Law, to post and use the material in your Content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent:

(a)            Your physical or electronic signature;

(b)            Identification of the Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the Content appeared before it was removed or disabled;

(c)             A statement that you have a good faith belief that the Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the Content; and

(d)            Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in San Francisco, California, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.

If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, SnapMagic Search may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed Content or cease disabling it in ten (10) business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the Content provider, member or user, the removed Content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in ten (10) to fourteen (14) business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at SnapMagic Search's sole discretion.
